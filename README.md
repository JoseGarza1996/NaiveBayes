Naive Bayes is a machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which is a statistical formula that describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Naive Bayes is called "naive" because it makes the assumption that all features (i.e., attributes) of a data point are independent of each other, which is often not true in real-world scenarios.

In Naive Bayes classification, the algorithm learns the probabilities of each class based on the features in the training data. When presented with new data, the algorithm uses these probabilities to predict the class of the new data point. Specifically, it calculates the posterior probability of each class given the features of the new data point, and then selects the class with the highest probability as the predicted class.

Naive Bayes has several advantages, including its simplicity, speed, and effectiveness on small and high-dimensional datasets. It is commonly used for text classification, spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and other similar tasks. However, its assumption of feature independence may not hold in some real-world scenarios, which can lead to suboptimal performance.
